 We propose a modified model based on learning self-attetnion module disected into  spatial and channel attention which shows a better improvement in the generic classfication tasks. Our Current experiments is carried out on the Person-ReID tasks which is framed as a classification problem. The here is mainly based on the work in Parameter-Free Spatial Attention Network for Person Re-Identification and PCB.
This code is implementain of the paper entitled DEEPLY SUPERVISED SELF-ATTENTION LEARNING MODEL FOR PERSON RE-IDENTIFICATION.
